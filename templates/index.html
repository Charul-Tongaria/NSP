            <h2>About This Project</h2>
            <p>
                The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on the world, affecting virtually every aspect of daily life, including health, education, and economic systems. 
                This project aims to provide a detailed analysis of the available COVID-19 data, focusing on key areas such as:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Health Impact:</strong> We analyze the spread of the virus, the number of cases, and the mortality rates across different countries.</li>
                <li><strong>Liver Cancer Research:</strong> The project investigates how the pandemic has influenced liver cancer treatments and outcomes, particularly in countries that were severely affected by COVID-19.</li>
                <li><strong>Educational Disruption:</strong> We study how COVID-19 impacted education globally, tracking school closures, shifts to online learning, and the long-term effects on students' academic progress.</li>
                <li><strong>Vaccination Efforts:</strong> The analysis extends to vaccination campaigns, comparing the rate of vaccinations in different countries and how effective these campaigns have been in curbing the spread of the virus.</li>
            </ul>
